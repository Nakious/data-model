Class:

Tutor:
  - version: 1
    attributes:
      - name
      - employee_id
      - classes # This should store the class_id's of the classes they teach
    relationships:
      - target: Class
        type: one_to_many
        attribute: classes # Links back to Class via class_id
        # attribute: classes_taught  # An alternative derived attribute (it could be stored or managed through a join table or lookup but is not explicitly part of the tutor's direct attributes). This setup avoids storing class IDs directly in the tutor record, maintaining 3NF.
